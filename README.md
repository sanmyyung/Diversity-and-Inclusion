# Diversity-and-Inclusion

# Introduction
This report presents an analysis of a telecom client's diversity and inclusion data using a Power BI dashboard. The primary focus is to evaluate gender diversity and inclusion efforts, especially at the executive management level, and suggest strategies to improve gender balance. The report highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) related to hiring, promotions, employee turnover, and performance ratings by gender across various regions and departments.
## Dashboard Overview
The Diversity and Inclusion dashboard is split into two main sections, each offering crucial insights into the client's workforce dynamics:

#### A.  Global Diversity Overview: 
Displays total employee count, breakdown by gender, and regional differences.
#### B. Promotion, Hiring, and Performance Trends: 
Shows promotion rates, hiring metrics, turnover, and performance ratings, with a focus on gender representation across job levels and departments.
## Key Metrics and Insights
   #### Total Workforce Overview:
#### i. Total Employees: 
500 employees, with 295 men and 205 women.
#### ii. Total Leavers: 
47 employees left the company during FY20, but the gender breakdown of these leavers requires closer attention to understand turnover dynamics.
#### iii. Gender Distribution by Region:
Switzerland shows a higher proportion of men (169 men vs 95 women), while Europe has more balanced figures (120 men vs 104 women). Other regions like Americas, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East have minimal presence, which is an area for growth.
## Hiring Trends:
####  Percentage of Hires FY20:
51.52% men and 48.48% women were hired in FY20.
The close gender balance in hiring indicates strong efforts toward diversity in recruitment, but more work is needed to translate these hiring efforts into leadership roles.
## Promotion Metrics:
#### i. Promotions in FY20:
28 men and 8 women were promoted, reinforcing the need for a more balanced promotion strategy, especially considering the large number of male executives.
#### ii. FY21 Promotion Rate:
43.98% of men and 56.02% of women were promoted, reflecting a significant positive trend toward promoting women.
This may indicate a focus on gender diversity in promotions, especially considering women's underrepresentation at higher management levels.
## Job Level Analysis:
#### i. Before FY20 Promotions:
Senior roles like Executive (8 men, 4 women) and Director (28 men, 4 women) reflect an overwhelming male dominance in leadership, highlighting the challenge the client is facing in improving gender balance at the executive level.
#### ii. After FY20 Promotions:
While the promotion of women into higher roles is evident, men still dominate executive, director, and senior manager positions. For example, after promotions, 14 men hold executive roles compared to 2 women, and Director-level roles still show a 32 to 5 imbalance.
## Performance Ratings:
Average performance ratings vary by gender across departments:
#### i. Strategy: 
Men 2.63, Women 2.00
#### ii. Finance: 
Men 2.60, Women 2.20
#### In many departments, men received higher average performance ratings, which raises questions about performance assessment criteria and gender biases. The data suggests the need for a review of how performance is evaluated.
## Trends and Insights
#### i. Gender Imbalance in Leadership:
The data shows a significant gender imbalance at the highest levels of the company, particularly at the executive and director levels. Although women make up a considerable portion of the workforce (41%), they are underrepresented in senior leadership positions. The low number of women in executive roles (2 women vs 14 men) signals that the efforts to promote gender diversity at the top are not yet yielding the desired results.
#### ii. Promotion Trends:
The promotion rates of women in FY21 (56.02%) are encouraging. However, the historical trend shows that men are still disproportionately promoted to top-level positions. If sustained, this trend of promoting more women may gradually improve the gender balance in leadership, but more aggressive strategies may be required to accelerate this progress.
## Recommendations
#### i. Increase Focus on Leadership Development for Women:
Implement leadership development programs tailored for women to increase their representation in senior management roles. Mentorship programs with senior executives can help bridge the gap.
Review Promotion Criteria:

#### ii. Evaluate the promotion process to ensure it is transparent and free from bias: 
This can help close the gap in executive-level promotions for women and ensure that qualified women are considered for leadership positions.
Performance Review Processes:

#### iii. Standardize performance review processes across departments to ensure gender fairness:
Training evaluators on unconscious bias can also improve the objectivity of ratings.
#### iv. Track and Expand Regional Diversity:
With limited presence outside of Europe and Switzerland, the company should track diversity metrics by region and work to expand representation in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East.
#### v. Set Clear KPIs for Gender Diversity:

Establish measurable KPIs, such as increasing the number of women in executive positions by a certain percentage over the next 2-3 years. Monitoring these KPIs closely will help guide efforts and measure success.
## Conclusion
This dashboard reveals the telecom clientâ€™s strong commitment to diversity and inclusion but also highlights significant gaps in gender balance at the senior management level. While hiring practices show balanced gender representation, promotions and leadership roles remain dominated by men. Addressing these issues through targeted leadership programs, revisiting promotion criteria, and focusing on performance fairness can help the client achieve its diversity goals and foster a more inclusive work environment.
By leveraging these insights, the telecom client can make data-driven decisions to improve gender diversity, ensuring a more equitable and diverse workforce in the future.
